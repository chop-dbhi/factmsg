## Fields

- [`spec`](#spec)
- [`time`](#time)
- [`value`](#value)
- [`name`](#name)
- [`domain`](#domain)
- [`revision`](#revision)
- [`version`](#version)
- [`labels`](#labels)
- [`refs`](#refs)
- [`meta`](#meta)

### `spec`

- Required: **Yes**
- Type: string

The [semantic version](http://semver.org) of the specification the fact was produced against.

This is to ensure consumers can check for compatibility when consuming a fact.


### `time`

- Required: **Yes**
- Type: integer

A [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) timestamp in nanoseconds.

The `time` denotes when the [value](#value) was asserted and therefore valid. Subsequent facts that assert a value for the same [entity](#name) implicitly invalidates the previous values.


### `value`

- Required: **Yes**
- Type: any type

The value of an entity being asserted.

A value is, by definition, immutable. If assigned to an [entity](#name), this is referred to as the *state* of the entity at the associated time.


### `name`

- Required: No
- Type: string
- Regexp: `^([a-z])([a-z][0-9]-._)*$`

The name of the entity the [value](#value) is assigned to.

The name is part of the *identity* of an entity, along with the [domain](#domain) if defined.


### `domain`

- Required: No
- Type: string
- Regexp: `^([a-z])([a-z][0-9]-._)*$`

The domain the [name](#name) is uniquely defined in.

The domain is part of the *identity* of an entity, along with the [name](#name).


### `revision`

- Required: No
- Type: string

The revision of the [entity](#name) for the current [value](#value).

The revision string must have a [one-to-one correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection) to state. A good example of this behavior are [Git commit hashes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects#Commit-Objects).


### `version`

- Required: No
- Type: string

The [release version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle) of the [entity](#name) the current state is associated with.

This must be a valid [semantic version](http://semver.org).


### `labels`

- Required: No
- Type: set of strings

Labels are used to classify the entity or value if not assigned.


### `refs`

- Required: No
- Type: map of references

`refs` are used to model relationships to other entities.

The references may be local (defined in the same domain) or remote (defined in an external domain). A `time`, `revision`, or `version` of the reference may be included to increase the specificity of the state. In programming terms, when the reference is [*dereferenced*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dereference_operator), the value that is returned depends on which field (if any) was used in the reference definition.

As noted above, a `revision` is the most granular since it has a one-to-one correspondence to a particular state. Specifying a `time` will result in a reference value that is the *closest, but not exceeding* the time. A `version` will result in the latest value assigned to the version.

### `meta`

- Required: No
- Type: map

The `meta` field is a map of additional information about the fact.

No explicit semantics have been defined for this field.


## Encoding

[MsgPack](http://msgpack.org) is the chosen encoder because has a balance of flexibility and performance. In addition, there is a MsgPack implementation for all [mainstream languages](http://msgpack.org/#languages).

### Types

Table of specific MsgPack types for each field.

`value` | `<T>` (any type)
`name` | `str8`
`domain` | `str8`
`revision` | `str8`
`version` | `fixstr`
`labels` | `fixarray`
`refs` | `map16`
`meta` | `map16`
