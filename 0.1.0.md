## Fields

Field | Type | Description | Constraints | Semantics
------|------|-------------|-------------|----------
`spec` | `string` | The [semantic version](http://semver.org/) of the specification. | This must be a valid spec version. |
`domain` | `string` | The domain or namespace of the value's identity. | Allowed characters `[A-Z][a-z][0-9]-._` |  See [identity](#identity)
`name` | `string` | The name of the value's identity. | Requires `domain` to be set. Allowed characters `[A-Z][a-z][0-9]-._` |  See [identity](#identity)
`version` | `string` | Following the SemVer constraint, this field defines the version of the entity this is associated with. | Requires a valid SemVer version string. | See [versioning](#versioning)
`revision` | `string` | Uniquely identifies the value for the [identity](#identity). | - | See [versioning](#versioning)
`time` | `uint64` | A Unix epoch timestamp in nanoseconds when the message was produced. If not supplied, this will be generated by client librarie of this specification. | - |
`value` | `<T>` | The value of the message. | The opaque value of the message. |
`refs` | `map[string]map[string]<T>` | A set of references to other entities. | At minimum, each `ref` must define the `name` field which is the identity being referenced. Any of the additional may be included with the exception of `refs`. | See [references](#references)
`meta` | `map[string]<T>` | A set of metadata to annotate the entity. | - | See [metadata](#metadata)
`labels` | `[]string` | A set of strings that annotate the message. | Allowed characters `[A-Z][a-z][0-9]-._` | See [labels](#labels)

## Semantics

### Identity

An identity identifies a persistent thing that changes state over time. It is composed of the `domain` and `name` fields where the `domain` acts as a namespace for a set of related identities and the `name` is unique in that domain. The rule of thumb for whether a value should have an identity is if the identity will change over time or the value itself needs to be "looked up" in a downstream system. For example, events or actions are values that typically do not require an identity since they are rarely consumed or evaluated invidually, but rather in aggregate. However, objects and other entities would have an identity since their state generally changes over time.

From a tooling standpoint, messages can be consumed

### Versioning

The `version` and `revision` fields may be used to add explicit version information to the value if it available. The `revision` field uniquely identifies the value relative to the [identity](#identity). For example, the [commit SHA-1](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection#Single-Revisions) is a revision string that uniquely identifies the state of a Git repository.

From a consumer standpoint, if a message is seen with the same identity and revision that was previously seen, the message may be dropped. If the message is consumed anyway, the value is assumed to be the same.

The `version` field may be used if a higher-level [semantic version](http://semver.org) of the identity is known. Using analogy to Git, a `version` would correspond to the pending [tagged release](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) such as `1.3.4`. This ties together sets of values that were associated to a particular version.

### References

It is common for values to have references to other values, either locally (in the same domain) or remotely (external domain). The `refs` object defines a set of named references to other values identitied by the `domain` and `name` fields. In addition, the [version fields](#versioning) may be supplied to specify the version of the value being reference. This may be useful if the current value depends on an older version of the referenced value. If the version information is not set, the `time` field implicitly denotes when the reference was known to be valid.

### Metadata

The `meta` field is a set of key-value pairs that may contain additional domain-specific information.

### Labels

A set of `labels` may be supplied to classify the value. In general these should be short and simple. Consumers should treat labels unique to the particular domain the value is defined in.
